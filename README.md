## Code Optimizations

### 1. Mathematical Simplifications:
Simple mathematical operations were optimized for faster computation. For instance, multiplications by 0.5 were replaced by divisions by 2, which can be faster in some architectures.

### 2. Comments for Potential Optimizations:
Comments were added in the FORTRAN code to highlight areas that may benefit from further review and optimization, particularly:
- Loop structures
- MPI communication calls
- Subroutine calls

### 3. Makefile Compiler Flags:
The makefile was updated with optimization flags suitable for the FORTRAN compiler:
- `-O3`: Enables high-level optimizations.
- `-march=native`: Optimizes for the specific architecture of the compiling machine.
- `-funroll-loops`: Enables loop unrolling for small loops.

### Rationale & Methodology:

The code optimizations were based on general FORTRAN optimization techniques and best practices. While these modifications can enhance performance, it's crucial to test the code in the target environment and benchmark its performance against the original version.

Loop structures, MPI calls, and subroutine calls were highlighted as they typically represent computationally intensive sections in simulation codes. Efficient handling of these areas can significantly improve performance.

Compiler flags were chosen based on commonly used optimization practices for FORTRAN code, targeting both computational efficiency and architecture-specific optimizations.
